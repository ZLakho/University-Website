<section class="LABORATRIES">
  <h1><u>List of Laboratories:</u></h1>
  <ul><li> 
  <h2>1.Digital Electronics Lab:</h2>
  <p>Digital Electronics Laboratory offers basic and advanced logic design experiments raging from logic gates to 
    sequential logic design. The students provided with both software and hardware resources to design and test 
    digital logic circuits. The lab is equipped KL-300 digital trainer for courses like Microprocessor-based system
     design, digital logic design and sequential circuit design. Latest equipment such as digital oscilloscope of 
     200 MHz with built in logic analyzer is also available which is used to test the logic circuits and traditional
      combinational logic circuits. In additional to that dual power supply with master slave configuration and cutting
       edge technology based function generators are also available for design and troubleshooting of electronic 
       equipment’s.</p>
       <h2>2.Computer Programming Lab:</h2>
       <p>Computer Laboratory is equipped with state of the art Core i5 computers. The lab is designed to allow the 
         students experiments with the latest computing technology to solve engineering problems. The lab is purpose
          built with an environment which simulates student’s creativity. Engineering related applications/software 
          are available in this lab for students such as LabVIEW and Matlab. Similarly programming related applications
           such as C++ compilers, Java & CAD tools are available to facilitate the students.</p>
       <h2>3.Embedded Systems Lab:</h2>
       <p>Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Laboratory in the computer Systems Engineering Department is equipped with
          the state of the art technology tools. In this lab, equipment’s such as Latest Xilinx FPGAs boards, and Lego
           Mind Strom Robots are available for courses like artificial intelligence and Embedded System Design.</p>
      <h2>4.Data Communication and Networks Lab:</h2>
      <p>Communication and Network laboratory has state of the art Communication Systems & networking equipment’s 
        comprises of trainers such as wave propagation and antenna equipment WATS-2002, Mobile communication trainer
         MW-1000 and microwave device experiment MW-100 whereas networking equipment’s comprises of CISCO router, CISCO
          switches and wireless LAN equipment WLAN-TS 1000. The hardware based trainers are very powerful and flexible,
           therefore can be used in teaching communication systems courses such as Mobile Computing, Signals & Systems
            and digital signal processing for the digital signal processing purpose specific hardware equipment’s such as
             DSP kits and Xilinx FPGAs are also available to students to run DSP experiments.</p>
      <h2>5.Computer Programming Lab 2:</h2>
